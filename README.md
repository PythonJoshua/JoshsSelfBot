# JoshsSelfBot
Small Project for some friends.

# Why I created this.
I created this because I was bored, I made this in the span of like 8 hours.

# Who is this for?
Myself and some friends.

# Likely to get banned while using?
No, your not likely going to get banned due to no embeds being sent, only normal text you can do without self bots, this is just automation for when you type certain things.

# Safety
Embeds are optional, if I ever add embeds it will be a 100% optional command, where you can either toggle it or their will be mulitple versions of a command.

# Why is it compiled?
I want to keep my work, as MY work, I do not want people taking my code and using it as their own and taking credits.

# Support/Bugs
I will not be sharing a discord server or my discord username for any support for this tool, use this at your own will, I am not responsible for any banned accounts or server bans!

# Disclaimer
The only time you'd most likely get banned in is if a user reports you, when using self bots I recommend just using them in DMs with your friends for a joke, someone you can trust to not report you.

Thank you for using my tool, and I hope you have fun!
I will not work on this much due to discord TOS, but yeah.
